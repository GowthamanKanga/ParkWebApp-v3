      description: `The Toronto Islands provide a great, refreshing escape from
        downtown with a beautiful view of Lake Ontario on one side, and
        the city skyline on the other. The park offers a range of
        activities, including biking, picnicking, and beach-going. It's
        the perfect place to relax and enjoy the sunshine on a hot
        summer day, or take in the stunning views of the city and lake
        in the evening. Whether you're a local or just visiting, Toronto
        Island Park is definitely worth checking out.`,
